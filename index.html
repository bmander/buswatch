    <h1>BusWatch - get bus times on your watch</h1>
    <p>BusWatch is an Android app that shows real-time transit arrival times on your bluetooth phone. Maybe it's cold and you have your gloves on. Maybe you're puttering around the house and want to keep an eye on the bus without keeping your phone out. Maybe you're walking to the bus and want to know if you should hurry or stroll. It's often super handy to have bus times right there on your wrist.</p>
